  Uses Spence Konde's ATTinyCore boards:
  https://github.com/SpenceKonde/ATTinyCore
  https://github.com/SpenceKonde/ATTinyCore/blob/master/Installation.md
  Add this URL to the Additional Boards Manager URLs in File\Preferences:
  http://drazzy.com/package_drazzy.com_index.json
  and then use the Boards Manager to add support for the ATtiny

  Set Board to ATtiny441/841 (No bootloader)
  Set Chip to ATtiny841
  Set Clock to 8MHz(internal)
  Set BOD Level to BOD Enabled 1.8V
  Set BOD Mode (Active) and (Sleep) to BOD Disabled
  Set Save EEPROM to EEPROM Not Retained
  * Set Pin Mapping to Clockwise *
  * Set Wire Modes to Slave Only *

  If you are using AVRDUDESS to program the ATtiny841, set the Fuses to:
  L: 0xE2 (CKDIV8 disabled, CKOUT disabled, SUT slowly rising, CKSEL internal 8MHz)
  H: 0xDF (RSTDISBL not disabled, DWEN not enabled, SPIEN enabled, WDTON not always on, EESAVE EEPROM not retained, BOD disabled)
  E: 0xFF (SELFPRGEN disabled)

  Pin Allocation:
  0:  Physical Pin 13 (PA0)           : 9603N ON_OFF - pull high to enable the 9603N, pull low to disable it
  1:  Physical Pin 12 (PA1 / TXD0)    : Serial Tx - connected to 9603N TX(IN)
  2:  Physical Pin 11 (PA2 / RXD0)    : Serial Rx - connected to 9603N RX(OUT)
  3:  Physical Pin 10 (PA3)           : PWR_EN - pull high to enable the 5.3V supply to the 9603N via the P-FET
  4:  Physical Pin 9  (PA4 / SCL/SCK) : I2C SCL
  5:  Physical Pin 8  (PA5 / MISO)    : MISO - connected to pin 1 of the ISP header
  6:  Physical Pin 7  (PA6 / MOSI/SDA): I2C SDA
  7:  Physical Pin 6  (PA7)           : 9603N Network Available - high when the 9603 can successfully receive the Ring Channel
  8:  Physical Pin 5  (PB2)           : LTC3225 Power Good - goes high when the supercapacitors are charged (will also be high when !SHDN is low!)
  9:  Physical Pin 3  (PB1 / INT0)    : 9603N Ring Indicator - will pulse high twice when a new Mobile Terminated SBD message is available
  10: Physical Pin 2  (PB0)           : LTC3225 !SHDN - pull low to disable the supercapacitor charger
  11: Physical Pin 4  (!RESET / PB3)  : ATtiny841 !Reset

  The ATtiny's I2C address is 0x63

  The I2C 'registers' are:
  IO_REG: 0x10 (the I/O pin register)
  LEN_REG: 0xFD (the serial length register: 2 bytes (MSB, LSB) indicating how many serial characters are available to be read)
  DATA_REG: 0xFF (the serial data register: used to read and write serial data from/to the 9603N)

  To read the I/O pins, the Master should: beginTransmission(0x63); write(0x10); endTransmission(false); requestFrom(0x63, 1);

  To write to the I/O pins, the Master should: beginTransmission(0x63); write(0x10); write(<new_output_pin_configuration>); endTransmission(); 
  
  Use a read-modify-write approach when setting output pin(s).

  To write serial data to the 9603N, the Master should: beginTransmission(0x63); write(0xFF); write each byte; endTransmission();

  If there are more than 32 bytes to be written, multiple cycles should be used using endTransmission(false) so the bus is not released part way through.

  To read serial data from the 9603N, the Master should: beginTransmission(0x63); write(0xFD); endTransmission(false); requestFrom(0x63, 2);
  
  The two bytes returned by the requestFrom will be the number of bytes waiting in the serial buffer in MSB, LSB format

  The Master should then request _all_ the serial data (up to) SER_PACKET_SIZE (default 8) bytes at a time from the DATA_REG 'register' 0xFF.
  E.g. if there are 13 bytes waiting to be read, the Master should:

  beginTransmission(0x63); write(0xFF); endTransmission(false);
  requestFrom(0x63, 8, false);
  requestFrom(0x63, 5);

  (This is because the requestEvent does not know how many bytes have been requested!)

  The Ring Indicator bit in the IO_REGISTER is a flag set by the RI signal via INT0.
  To clear the flag: read the I/O pins; clear the IO_RI bit; write the new pin configuration.
